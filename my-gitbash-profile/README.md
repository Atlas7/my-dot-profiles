# README.md

Place these files in the top level directory. e.g.

```
C:\Users\Johnny
```

These files contains features like:

- GitBash command prompt color syntax
- GitBash auto-completion (using the tab key)
- Use the `subl` command to call the Sublime Text Editor.

Change the files as needed.

I obtained these original files as a by-product of taking the [Udacity How to use Git and GitHub course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).
